About 
about skill education dll

Nice to meet you I'm Sebastian, a multi-disciplinary designer from Germany based in Tokyo. I can't really show much of what Iâ€™m working on, but it has to do with cars, software and urban development. The site you see here is more meant to be a playground for the stuff I do besides my work. Enjoy, have fun and feel free to reach out.
